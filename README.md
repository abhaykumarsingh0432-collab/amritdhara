Amritdhara - Al-powered Chatbot for Water Conservation

I developed Amritdhara, an Al-powered chatbot aimed at spreading awareness and promoting sustainable water conservation practices.

The idea behind this project was to use Artificial Intelligence for social good-helping users understand water scarcity issues and adopt better water-saving habits through interactive conversations.

This project strengthened my understanding of Al concepts, problem-solving, and building technology with real-world impact.

I'm open to feedback and learning opportunities.
